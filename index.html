              <h3>About Me</h3>
              <p>
                Hi! My name is Jacob (Freeman) Nkouka, a full-stack developer
                from Denver, Colorado, passionate about applying software
                engineering to machine learning and AI. My family is from Togo,
                a country in West Africa. I also have roots in Ghana and the
                Republic of Congo (Congo-Brazzaville). That heritage grounds me
                — it’s a reminder that technology isn’t just about innovation;
                it’s about building tools that create opportunity, connect
                people, and solve real problems that matter.
                <br /><br />
                I’m a junior at the University of Notre Dame, pursuing a double
                major in Computer Science and Applied and Computational
                Mathematics and Statistics (ACMS). I’ve always enjoyed the
                structure of math and the creativity of programming — and over
                time, I’ve come to see how the two complement each other in
                powerful ways.
                <br /><br />
                Whether I’m building a task manager, an AI-powered algorithm
                visualizer, or a productivity tool, I enjoy designing systems
                that are both practical and thoughtfully engineered.
                <a href="/projects.html"
                  >You can explore some of my work on the Projects page.</a
                >
                <br /><br />
                Outside of class, I value collaboration, community, and
                continuous learning. I believe the best growth comes from
                building — and I’m always looking for ways to take on new
                challenges and refine my craft.
                <br /><br />
                Feel free to reach out — I’m always open to interesting
                projects, new ideas, or a good conversation about systems and
                software.

                Explaining complex CS and math concepts clearly — helping others

              <br />
              <li>
                Thinking abstractly when approaching problems — comfortable

                    I worked as a tutor for the Learning Resource Center (LRC),

                    Pre-Calculus, Calculus I–III & A–B, Linear Algebra, and
                    Differential Equations.
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        In addition, I served as a Calculus Huddle Leader,
                        meeting every Sunday with a group of seven Calculus I
                        students.

                      <li>
                        Unlike general tutoring sessions, these huddles were
                        highly personalized — I adapted explanations to each
                        student’s learning style, offered targeted deep dives
                        into challenging concepts, and fostered a collaborative
                        environment where students could learn from both me and
                        each other.

                    Led a 15-person research team in analyzing student
                    motivation and counselor access by surveying over 100 NEC
                    students. Our project for the 2023 Annual 5280 Challenge
                    explored how communication platforms like Remind influenced
                    student engagement and access to support.

                      <li>
                        Discovered that fewer than 50% of 9th–11th graders
                        regularly used the Remind app for school updates,
                        compared to 75% of seniors.

                      <li>
                        Found that 49.2% of surveyed students felt confident
                        relying on their counselors for academic and
                        post-graduation guidance.

                      <li>
                        Used these insights to propose policy improvements aimed
                        at strengthening student-counselor relationships and
                        communication outreach.
