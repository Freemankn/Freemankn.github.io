          Hi! My name is Jacob (Freeman) Nkouka. I'm a full-stack developer
          passionate about applying software engineering to machine learning and
          AI.
          <br /><br />
          I’m currently a junior at the University of Notre Dame, double
          majoring in Computer Science and Applied and Computational Mathematics
          and Statistics (ACMS). I’ve always enjoyed the structure of math and
          the creativity of programming — and over time, I’ve come to see how
          the two complement each other in powerful ways.

          <br /><br />
          My coding journey started in high school with Python, and since then,
          I’ve expanded into Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, MATLAB, HTML/CSS,
          and full-stack development. Whether I’m building a task manager, an
          AI-powered algorithm visualizer, or a productivity tool, I enjoy
          designing systems that are both practical and thoughtfully engineered.

          <br /><br />
          Outside of class, I value collaboration, community, and continuous
          learning. I believe the best growth comes from building — and I’m
          always looking for ways to take on new challenges and refine my craft.
          <br /><br />
          Feel free to reach out — I’m always open to interesting projects, new
          ideas, or a good conversation about systems and software.
        </p>
