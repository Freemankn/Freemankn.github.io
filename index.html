            Hi! My name is Jacob (Freeman) Nkouka. I'm a full-stack developer
            passionate about applying software engineering to machine learning
            and AI.
            <br /><br />
            I’m currently a junior at the University of Notre Dame, double
            majoring in Computer Science and Applied and Computational
            Mathematics and Statistics (ACMS). I’ve always enjoyed the structure
            of math and the creativity of programming — and over time, I’ve come
            to see how the two complement each other in powerful ways.

            <br /><br />
            My coding journey started in high school with Python, and since
            then, I’ve expanded into Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, MATLAB,
            HTML/CSS, and full-stack development. Whether I’m building a task
            manager, an AI-powered algorithm visualizer, or a productivity tool,
            I enjoy designing systems that are both practical and thoughtfully
            engineered.

            <br /><br />
            Outside of class, I value collaboration, community, and continuous
            learning. I believe the best growth comes from building — and I’m
            always looking for ways to take on new challenges and refine my
            craft.
            <br /><br />
            Feel free to reach out — I’m always open to interesting projects,
            new ideas, or a good conversation about systems and software.
          </p>
